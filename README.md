## Model description
### Sampling algorithms
Our model predicts and recommends graph sampling algorithms of three categories, based on quality and performance metrics. It considers twelve sampling algorithms listed below:
* Node-based sampling
   * Random node
   * Random degree node
* Edge-based sampling
   * Random edge
   * Rendom node-edge
   * Induced random edge
* Traversal sampling
   * Random jump
   * Metropolis-Hastings random walk
   * SnowBall
   * Forest Fire
   * Frontier
   * Rank degree
   * Expansion
###  Sampling quality metrics
We consider three quality metrics (distribution divergences) for evaluating sampling algorithms: degree distribution (D3), clustering coefficient distribution (C2D2), hop-plots distribution (HPD2), and hop-plots distribution for the largest connected component (HPDC) divergence.
### Sampling performance metric
We consider the execution time of graph sampling algorithms as the performance metric.

### ML models
Our tool consists of three ML models:
* Random forest (RF)
* k nearest neighbor (kNN)
* Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)

## Data generation

### Dataset details

#### Train synthetic graphs
We generated five types of synthetic graphs, with the following settings.

**Albert-Barabasi**
These graphs consist of 64 graphs with 10,000 ~ 100,000 nodes, and densities in [0.00001, 0.001], generated with [Networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph.html).
We calculate the new edge numbers per node parameter (NewEdgesPerNode) as follows (N: node numbers, D: graph density, m: new edge numbers per node):

$$m = \lfloor(N * D / 2)\rfloor$$
 
- m: 1~42
	
**Watts-Strogatz**
Watts-Strogatz graphs include 119 graphs with 10,000 ~ 100,000 nodes and densities in [0.00001, 0.001], generated with **Networkx**.
The following equation gives the number of neighbors of each node (|Nei|) in the ring topology, given N and D:

$$|Nei| = \lfloor(D * (N - 1))\rfloor$$

- $$|Nei|$$: 2~98
  
**Erdos-Renyi**
These graphs consist of 173 graphs with 10,000 ~ 100,000 nodes and edge probabilities (densities) in [0.00001, 0.001], generated with **Networkx**.

**PowerLawCluster**
PowerLawCluster graphs of **Networkx** include 60 graphs with adjusted parameters (new edge numbers per node m and TriangleProb) to produce densities in  [0.00001, 0.001] and average clustering coefficient (CC) in [0.1, 0.6] extracted from real graph properties.

10,000 | 2 | 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6
10,000 | 3 | 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1

45,000 | 20 | 1

**Forest-Fire**
The evolution-based Forest-Fire graphs consist of 36 graphs with 10,000 ~ 100,000 nodes and adjusted forward/backward probabilities to produce densities in [0.00004, 0.001]. We used [Snap-stanford](https://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/doc/reference/GenForestFire.html) library for their generation.

#Nodes | forward/backward probability 
--- | ---  
10,000 | 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
15,000 | 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
20,000 | 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
25,000 | 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
30,000 | 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
35,000 | 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
40,000 | 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
45,000 | 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
50,000 | 0.01, 0.2, 0.3

**Stochastic Block Model**
The clustering based graphs of the stochastic block model consist of 180 graphs with the following characteristics, generated with **Networkx** ($K$: number of clusters, $\alpha$: inter-intra cluster probability ratio):

$$N$$: 5,000, 15,000, 25,000, 35,000, 45,000

$$D$$: 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.0009

$$K$$: 10, 15, 20, 25

$$\alpha$$: 0.01, 0.001, 0.1

We calculated parameters of these graphs (cluster size $$N_c$$, inter cluster density $$\rho'$$ and intra cluster density $$\rho$$) according to the following equations :

$$\rho = (D * (N-1) * K) / (N - K + \alpha * N / (K - 2))$$

$$\rho' = \alpha * \rho$$

$$N_c = \lfloor N/K\rfloor$$
 

#### Test synthetic graphs
We generated 35 testing graphs of three types Albert-Barabasi, Erdos-Renyi, and Watts-Strogatz with 150,000-450,000 nodes and the following parameters:

* Albert-Barabasi with m of 1-22; 
* Watts-Strogatz with $$|Nei|$$ of 2-44;
* Erdos-Renyi with edge probabilities in [0.000008,0.0001].



#### Real graphs
We also tested our models on 16 publicly available real-world graphs of co-authorship, citation, technology, collaboration, and social graphs.

### Data generation instructions
To generate synthetic graphs inside folder "data preparation/graph generation" run the following command:

```
bash run_generate_synthetic_graphs -dataset_num data_folder_number
```

It generates synthetic graphs with the characteristics definded in dataset_info file of the specified folder number.

## Graph feature extraction
This script extracts some time-consuming features i.e. node/edge betweenness, eigenvector, pagerank, clustering coefficient, components sizes, maximum spannig tree degrees, shortest path lengths and assortativity with their statistics and distributions.
### Execution instruction
The following command to extracts the major features of all graphs in the specified folder:

```
bash run_parallel_major_feature_extraction_multi_graphs
```

## Graph sampling and evaluation
It includes sampling from several graphs and evaluating samples under three quality metrics (degree, clustering coefficent and hop-plots distribution divergences) and execution time. 

### Execution instruction
The following command collects samples (in parallel) from the graphs in the specified folder with the desired sampling settings such as sampling algorithms and number of iterations:

```
bash sample_from_several_large_graphs
```
Then running this command evaluates samples under quality metrics.
```
bash run_parallel_processing_samples_multi_graph
```

## Mutual information analysis and feature selection
Mutual information (MI) analysis in notebook *samplings_analysis_MI.ipynb* uses sklearn for selecting the most relevant features for each metric (quality and performance), having MI scores higher than 0.99 with at least one sampling algorithm. 
Concatenation of these features with sampling features (12 dimensional 1-hot vector for sampling algorithm, 3 dimensions for 1-hot vector of algorithm type and 1 dimention for rate) constitutes the input feature vector for ML models.


## Feature normalization
We normalize all graphs features using maximum and exponential-logarithmic (EL) applied for the following statistics:
* **Maximum normalization**: minimum, average and medium values
* **EL normalization**: maximum and variance values, calculation times, and raw features.

The notebook *create_datasets.ipynb* includes the steps for normalization.

## Data analysis
The notebook *data_analysis.ipynb* includes data analysis steps including duplicate train/test data elimination and visualization of train/test data features using t-SNE.

## Model training
Model training consists of constructing feature vectors for each sampling metric and training three ML models, RF, MLP and kNN with tuning their hyper-parameters (see notebook *train_models.ipynb*).  

### Hyper-parameter tuning
We performed five-fold cross validation using GreadSearchCV with following search space for different hyper-parameters of ML models, which results in the following hyper-parameters for each ML model.

Model | Hyperparameter | Search Space | Tuned value (D3/C2D2/HPD2/HPDC)
--- | ---  | --- | ---
kNN | algorithm | 'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute' | 'auto', 'ball_tree', 'ball_tree', 'ball_tree'
kNN | n_neighbors | 4, 5, 10, 15 | 4, 4, 15, 10
kNN | weights | 'uniform', 'distance' | 'distance', 'distance', 'distance', 'distance'
RF | bootstrap | True | True
RF | max_depth | None, 90, 100, 110 | None, None, None, None
RF | max_features | 2, 3 | 3, 3, 3, 3
RF | min_samples_leaf | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 2, 2, 2, 2
RF | min_samples_split | 8, 10, 12 | 8, 8, 8, 8
RF | n_estimators | 100, 200, 300, 400 | 100, 400, 400, 400
MLP | activation | 'tanh', 'relu' | 'tanh', 'tanh', 'relu', 'relu'
MLP | hidden_layer_sizes | (30), (50), (100), (30,30), (50,50), (100,100) | (100,100), (30,30), (100,100), (50,50)
MLP | solver | 'sgd', 'adam' | 'adam'
MLP | alpha | 0.0001, 0.05 |  0.0001
MLP | learning_rate | 'constant', 'adaptive' | 'constant'
MLP | shuffle | True | True
MLP | early_stopping | True | True

To run the model training and hyper-parameter tuning use *train_models/train_models.ipynb*.

## Model testing
The notebook *test_models/test_models.ipynb* tests the trained models on the test set.

## Result analysis

The notebook *result_analysis/result_analysis.ipynb* calculates RMSE of predictions for all metrics and compares top-k ranking accuracy in terms of *Hits@k* of ML models with two baseline methods *random selection* and *k-best selection*. 

## ML explainability
The notebook *result_analysis/ML-explainability* ranks different input graph and sampling features according to their calculated importance using LIME library. It provides average rankings for each ML model and quality metric.
